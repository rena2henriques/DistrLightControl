# DistrLightControl
Project for the course "Distributed Real-Time Control Systems"

The	 objective	 of	 this	 project	 consists	 on	 the	 real-time	 control	 of	 a	 distributed	
illumination	system	in	a	small	scale	model	of	an	office	space.	Each	desk	is	a	
smart	luminaire	composed	of	a	light	emitting	device,	a	luminance	sensor,	a	presence	
sensor,	 with	 computational	 and	 communication	 elements.	 	

The	 objective	 is	 to	 minimize	 the	 energy	 consumption	 and	 user	 comfort.	 Energy	
minimization	 is	 achieved	 by	 controlling	 the	 dimming	 level	 of	 each	 led	 such	 that	
occupied	 desks	 have	 luminance	 levels	 above	 a	 certain	 value	 (HIGH)	 and	 unoccupied	
desks	have	a	luminance	levels	above	a	lower	value	(LOW).	
User	comfort	is	maximized	by	keeping	the	illumination	always	above	
or	equal	to	the	minimum	levels,	and	minimizing	the	variations	of	the	illuminance	(flicker)	
during	desk	occupation.
